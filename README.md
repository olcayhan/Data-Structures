## Introduction

Data structures are fundamental building blocks in computer science and software development. They are essential for efficient data organization, manipulation, and retrieval. This repository aims to help developers understand and implement data structures in their projects.

## Data Structures Included

The following data structures are currently implemented in this repository:

- Array
- Linked List (Singly, Doubly)
- Stack
- Queue
- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree

Each data structure has its own folder, and within each folder, you will find the implementation along with documentation explaining its functionality and usage.

## How to Use

To use any of the data structures in your project, follow these steps:

1. Choose the programming language folder that matches your preferred language.
2. Navigate to the data structure folder you want to use.
3. Review the documentation and implementation details provided.
4. Copy the data structure implementation into your project.
5. Modify and integrate it into your codebase as needed.

Feel free to customize the implementations based on your specific requirements.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you find a bug, want to add new data structures, or improve existing ones, please submit a Pull Request. Make sure to follow the guidelines mentioned in the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.
